# A primitive GAN to generate 3D models
A GAN (General Adversarial Network) is a set of two neural networks competing against each other. The `generator` generatos an output which is then judged but a `discriminator`. The labels help us define the loss for both the networks, thus training them. (This is a very dumbed down description of the subject. Approaching it mathematically is beyond the scope of this project. More rigorous explanations [here](https://jaketae.github.io/study/gan-math/)

## Outline
This project aims to generate 3D shapes using a primitive GAN built from scratch in Python. The generator will be able to generate a sphere, a prism, a cube, and a cylinder.
