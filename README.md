# Generating 3D Models from 2D images
This repo is an LGM which takes as input a 2D image and creates a 3D representation. If the 2D image is from a diffusion model prompt, then this pipeline can be equivalent to a 3D generative model. The space and model are also hosted on [huggingface](https://huggingface.co/pimeson314).
